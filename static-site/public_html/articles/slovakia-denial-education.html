							<h1>Slovakia: supreme court rules that denial of inclusive education to children with disabilities can amount to discrimination</h1>
							<span class="news-article__date">29th October<br /> 2015</span>

								Ela is 10-years-old and has an intellectual disability and a hearing impairment. She lives in Bratislava, Slovakia with her
								parents who wanted her to study at the local mainstream primary school. In 2013, the school refused to enroll Ela
								saying they could not cope with her disabilities, a decision backed by the local government. Ela's parents lost a
								legal appeal and took their case to the Supreme Court. The case was litigated by Maro&#353; Matia&#353;ko, a human
								rights lawyer and the Mental Disability Advocacy Centre.
							</p>
							<p>
								In its judgment, the Slovak Supreme Court used international law to confirm that Ela has the right to be provided with the
								individualised support she needs to be educated alongside her peers in a mainstream school. In a powerful statement
								in favour of inclusion, the Court, quoting an expert opinion, said:
							</p>
							<p>
								"The presence of children with a disability in a group of healthy children is mutually enriching for both parties. Children
								learn empathy and acceptance of differences. Such an opportunity will provide the claimant with new patterns of behaviour
								and enables her a superior development of her mental capabilities."
							</p>
							<p>
								The Court also found that denial of support to enable Ela to access mainstream education could amount to unlawful discrimination
								which breached international law. The ruling is of significance to over 20,000 children with disabilities in Slovakia
								who end up placed in segregated educational provision, cut off from their peers, families and communities, and substantially
								damaging their life chances.
							</p>
							<p>
								Commenting on the judgment, Maro&#353; Matia&#353;ko, said:
							</p>
							<p>
								"The decision of the Slovakia Supreme Court underlines the right to inclusive education as fundamental for all children with
								disabilities, explicitly ruling that the CRPD imposes an obligation on schools and authorities to provide individualised
								support for such people. School segregation must now be consigned to history."
							</p>
							<p>
								Oliver Lewis, MDAC Executive Director, pointed out that the judgment is of global significance:
							</p>
							<p>
								"This judgment is a wake-up call for Slovakia and for countries around the world that segregate
								children with disabilities, or from ethnic minorities, into special schools that start them on a tragectory of social
								exclusion, unemployment, ill-health and poverty. The morally correct approach is inclusion. International human rights
								law demands it, the Sustainable Development Goals encourage it, and the Slovak Supreme Court has now ordered it."
							</p>
							<p>
								The judgment comes after increasing domestic and international scrutiny of Slovakia's poor record of ensuring the rights
								of children with disabilities. Earlier in October, Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights Nils Mui&#382;nieks

								<a href="http://www.mdac.org/en/news/council-europe-slovakia-must-get-children-out-institutions-and-inclusive-education">criticised
</a> the very high levels of educational segregation in Slovakia, calling on the country to come up with "clear plans
								for the transfer of children with disabilities from special to mainstream education". Also in October, the Regional
								Court in Bratislava criticised local authorities for

								<a href="http://www.mdac.org/en/news/slovakia-first-time-litigation-helps-4-year-old-girl-being-institutionalised">
    withholding in-home support
</a> to a 4-year-old girl with profound multiple disabilities, placing her at risk of separation from her parents
								and into an institution.
