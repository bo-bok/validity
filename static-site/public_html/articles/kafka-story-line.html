    <strong>
        You have a verbal argument with your girlfriend. The police come and
        take you to a psychiatric hospital. You've had a mental illness for
        many years. You're allergic to neuroleptic drugs and tell this to the
        psychiatrists. They ignore you, injecting you with the drugs. As a
        result your vision is impaired for a year. You are trapped for twenty
        days inside the psychiatric hospital. You can't complain to a court
        because your guardian (a local government bureaucrat you've never met)
        has signed some papers.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    "Milan S&#253;kora's case illustrates the very worst excesses of medicine
    and of law. Psychiatry still generates story-lines like a Franz Kafka
    novel. The government needs to prevent mental health systems from being
    used as a social dustbin", asserted Oliver Lewis, MDAC Executive Director.
    "The European Court of Human Rights accepts cases from all human beings
    irrespective of their legal status. We call on the Czech government to
    follow the same approach by amending the Civil Procedure Code to ensure
    access to justice for all".
</p>
<p>
    In the year 2000, Mr S&#253;kora, at that time 51 years old, was about to
    undergo a major change in his life, without even knowing. The local
    government of Brno (the Czech Republic's second largest city) had him
    placed under guardianship, not bothering to inform him about the court
    proceedings. Mr S&#253;kora was 'represented' by an employee of the court,
    who never met him or took instructions from him.
</p>
<p>
    Five years later, Mr S&#253;kora had a verbal dispute with his girlfriend.
    No violence was used, but the girlfriend called the police and ambulance.
    Mr S&#253;kora was taken to a psychiatric hospital because the girlfriend
    told the police that he had a mental illness. He didn't show any signs
    suggesting any reason for hospitalisation. On arrival to the hospital, a
    psychiatrist told him to take an oral dose of neuroleptic medication. Mr
    S&#253;kora refused, saying that he was allergic and the medication would
    cause serious side effects. The doctors ignored this refusal, and forcibly
    injected him with the drugs. As a direct result, his eyesight was impaired
    for a year afterwards.
</p>
<p>
    On day five out of his twenty days in hospital, Mr S&#253;kora contacted
    lawyers working for the Czech NGO the League of Human Rights and the Mental
    Disability Advocacy Center. Lawyers went to see him the same day, but Mr
    S&#253;kora's access to justice was blocked, because as a person under
    guardianship he needed the permission of his guardian to challenge the
    detention: the same guardian who approved the detention in the first place.
</p>
<p>
    Mr S&#253;kora took a case to the Constitutional Court, which refused to
    hear the case. Having filed his case in 2007, today he has seen justice.
    The European Court of Human Rights awarded him 20,000 EUR compensation and

        ruled
    </a>
    :
</p>
<p>
    &#183; It is nonsense to classify someone as being a 'voluntary' patient in
    a psychiatric hospital if that person doesn't want to be there (even if the
    patient's guardian wants that person to be there). (for lawyers: the Court
    said that this constitutes detention for the purposes of Article 5 of the
    European Convention on Human Rights - ECHR)- Denying a detained person the
    opportunity to challenge the detention before a court is unfair (violation
    of Article 5(4) ECHR).
</p>
<p>
    &#183; A law which allows Person A (the guardian) to authorise the
    detention of Person B (the person under guardianship) without any control
    whatsoever is arbitrary and unacceptable (the Court found a violation of
    Article 5(1) of the ECHR).
</p>
<p>
    &#183; Having a blunt system of guardianship where Person A takes decisions
    about Person B's life without ever meeting Person B has "serious
    consequences" for Person B. (guardianship interfered with the right to
    private life, and Court found a violation of Article 8 of the ECHR)
</p>
<p>
    Depriving someone of legal capacity and putting them under guardianship in
    proceedings where the legal representative of that person "effectively took
    no part in the proceedings" and where the judge "had no personal contact
    with the applicant" are "serious deficiencies" in the machinery of justice.
    (This also led the Court to find a violation of Article 8 of the ECHR)
