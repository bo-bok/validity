        The European Court of Human Rights found that 55-year-old Jaroslav
        &#268;ervenka from the Czech Republic was deceived and wrongfully held
        in a social care institution for eight months 
 
    <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-167125" target="_blank">
        (judgment here)
    </a>
        . MDAC calls on the Government to prohibit disability-based
        incarceration, and to evacuate the more than 28,000 people living in
        social care institutions, and provide supports to them in the
        community.
    </strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								A retired teacher with a mental health issue, Mr &#268;ervenka was placed under guardianship against his will in 2005. He
								battled through the courts to regain his legal autonomy, but failed. In February 2011, his guardian (a local government
								bureaucrat) told him that he was going for "spa treatment" for his injured leg. He was driven 100 km away but instead
								of arriving at a plush spa, Mr &#268;ervenka found himself in a building that reeked of urine and faeces.
							</p>
							<p>
								Locked in the institution and trapped in the legal lobsterpot of guardianship, he asked the staff when he could go home.
								"You are mistaken, nobody goes back home from here!" they replied. During those eight month he was forced to take
								Buronil, Tiapridal and Rispen, medication for schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease: conditions he did not have.
								His freedom was denied: he could only go on "organised walks", but not by himself. His mobile phone was taken away
								and letters were checked by staff. Meals were "overall horrible", he recalls, and there were no activities at all.
							</p>
							<p>
								Mr &#268;ervenka made complaints to all authorities, including the police. They all ignored him. That April he contacted
								lawyers from the League of Human Rights (a Czech NGO) who worked with the Mental Disability Advocacy Centre (MDAC).
								They took legal steps to get him out of the institution. They sent a complaint to the European Court of Human Rights.
							</p>
							<p>
								The "L&#225;zn&#283; Letiny" institution says it provides "care", but in reality is dilapidated, warehouses 260 people in
								shared rooms. "It was terrible, the first thing I noticed was that there were 50 men and only 2 toilets. There were
								used nappies everywhere on the ground. The cleaning was done only once a week," said Mr &#268;ervenka. Last year
								the Czech Ombudsman
								<a href="http://www.ochrance.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/ochrana_osob/ZARIZENI/Socialni_sluzby/21-2014-Letiny_2.pdf" target="_blank">
        told
    </a> the government to close the institution, an instruction the government has ignored.
							</p>
							<p>
								Following its case-law in another MDAC case
								<a href="http://www.mdac.org/en/22/11/12/kafka-story-line-european-court-human-rights" target="_blank">
									<em>S&#253;kora v. Czech Republic</em>
								</a>
								from 2012, the European Court of Human Rights today said that Mr &#268;ervenka was unlawfully detained through guardiansip.
								It found a violation of Article 5 of the European Convention of Human Rights (the right to liberty). The Court also
								held that he had been denied access to justice to challenge his detention.
							</p>
							<p>
								Zuzana Durajov&#225;, lawyer at LIGA said: "There might be hundreds or thousand people in the same situation as Mr. &#268;ervenka
								in the Czech Republic, left alone, living in inhuman and degrading conditions and being completely ignored by the
								authorities. The decision of the Strasbourg court is crucial, it sends a clear message to the state that these people
								deserve to be heard and be treated with respect and dignity."
							</p>
							<p>
								"Today's judgment is a wake-up call for the Czech Government. It should amend its law so it explicitly prohibits locking
								people with disabilities in institutions," said Ann Campbell, MDAC Litigation Director. "The Government must invest
								in community support services so that the more than 28,000 people currently warehoused in institutions can leave.
								This will prevent people having to endure not just months, but often their entire lives, segregated from society
								in conditions which are often appalling."
