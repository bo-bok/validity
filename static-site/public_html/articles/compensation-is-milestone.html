    <strong>
        The European Court of Human Rights has ordered the Russian government
        to pay 25,000 Euro compensation to a man with mental health
        disabilities. He was unlawfully stripped of his right to make
        decisions, and arbitrarily detained in a psychiatric hospital for more
        than six months. This is the largest amount of compensation the Court
        has ever awarded in a disability rights case.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    We welcome the 4 March 2010 European Court of Human Rights judgment in
    Shtukaturov v. Russia. This judgment is a follow-up of a decision by the
    Court in March 2008 that found that Russia was in violation of several
    provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights.
</p>
<p>
    Welcoming the judgment, Oliver Lewis our Executive Director said,
</p>
<p>
    "This judgment is a milestone for global human rights because 25,000 Euro
    is the largest amount of compensation the European Court of Human Rights
    has ever awarded to an applicant in a disability rights case. This sum
    reflects the gravity of human rights violations faced by people with
    disabilities the world over and the seriousness with which the mainstream
    human rights community now views these violations. The judgment sends a
    clear message to governments that it will be expensive if they fail to take
    legislative and policy action to effectively implement international human
    rights law for people with disabilities."
</p>
<p>
    In awarding compensation the Court noted that the Russian judicial system
    had failed to remedy the past wrongs which had Mr Shtukaturov suffered over
    the previous four years. As the Court noted in its March 2008 judgment Mr
    Shtukaturov was deprived of his right to make decisions in almost all areas
    of life. He was unlawfully detained in a psychiatric hospital for more than
    six months, not taking into account his subsequent periods of detention. Mr
    Shtukaturov's suffering was, the Court held last week, "undoubtedly
    aggravated by the State's failure to respect his [fair trial] rights and
    the authorities' interference with his right of individual petition [to the
    European Court of Human Rights]".
</p>
<p>
    The Court's scathing comments refer to the extraordinary way in which Mr
    Shtukaturov's legal capacity was eventually restored in May 2009 by a St.
    Petersburg district court. No steps were taken by any authority following
    the March 2008 judgment of the European Court of Human Rights. Nor were any
    steps taken by any authority following the February 2009 judgment of the
    Russian Constitutional Court, a case concerning Mr Shtukaturov and also
    initiated by MDAC. In this case the constitutional court struck down as
    unconstitutional provisions of the Psychiatric Care Act and the Code of
    Civil Procedure which had been applied in his case. Despite these judgments
    it was an unrelated application by the State guardianship authority in
    light of an perceived improvement in Mr Shtukaturov's mental health
    condition which eventually led to the restoration of his legal capacity.
    The district court's ruling did not cast doubt upon the validity of the
    original decision of the court, a remarkable oversight given the damning
    critique of the original decision both by Europe's human rights court and
    Russia's Constitutional Court. Now that he is no longer under guardianship,
    Mr Shtukaturov is at liberty to spend his compensation as he pleases.
