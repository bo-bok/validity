							<h1>Legal Capacity in Kenya</h1>
							<span class="news-article__date">April<br /> 2014</span>

						<div class="news-article__content">
							<p>
								In early April 2014 MDAC released a report "
								<a href="http://mdac.org/sites/mdac.info/files/mdac_kenya_legal_capacity_2apr2014.pdf">
        The Right to Legal Capacity in Kenya
    </a> ". For the first time in Africa, this report reveals how people's decision-making is taken away from them.
								It highlights the voices of people with intellectual disabilities and mental health issues themselves. The report
								provides recommendations to the Kenyan government to bring law and policy in line with international human rights
								lawlaw.
							</p>
							<p>
								The report exposes deeply-rooted oppression of people with intellectual and psycho-social disabilities, urging the Kenyan
								government to take practical actions to address widespread social stigma which restrict the daily lives of people
								with mental disabilities.
							</p>
							<p>
								The research uncovers widespread human rights violations at many levels, including the judicial restriction of legal capacity
								so that family members can control peoples' property, forced sterilisation of women without consent, widespread gender-based
								violence and denial of access to education and employment. Crucially, there is a complete lack of community-based
								supports to enable people with mental disabilities to exercise their decision-making rights, rendering many subject
								to the substituted decisions of families, community members and healthcare professionals.
							</p>
							<p>
								The right to legal capacity, set out in Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, is the
								legal grounding of the report, which analyses Kenyan legislation and social practices, describing in detail the daily
								restrictions placed on the lives of Kenyans with disabilities.
							</p>
							<p>
								The overwhelming conclusion is that Kenyan legislation arbitrarily restricts the legal recognition of people with intellectual
								disabilities and people with psycho-social disabilities and fails to provide supports to help them make decisions
								for themselves. Legal and social barriers then entrench the deeply-rooted social prejudices that heavily restrict
								the lives of people with disabilities.
							</p>
							<p>
								The report makes 10 recommendations to the Kenyan government, which will help to reverse the cultural stigma of people with
								disabilities in Kenya. Acting on the recommendations will allow people with disabilities to gain control over their
								lives, with supports where necessary, and allow them to truly feel like active members of society.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>The recommendations include:</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								&#183; Legislating for the recognition of legal capacity in all areas of life for people with mental disabilities;
							</p>
							<p>
								&#183; Ensuring all people mental disabilities can gain national identity cards, and that this data is used to plan government
								services which address their human rights;
							</p>
							<p>
								&#183; Abolishing formal and informal substituted decision-making systems which deny people with mental disabilities from
								making choices in their own lives;
							</p>
							<p>
								&#183; Removal of discriminatory terms in Kenyan legislation, including 'unsound mind', 'mental incapacity' and 'mental infirmity';
							</p>
							<p>
								&#183; Combatting high levels of abuse and violence, including gender-based violence, ensuring that access to justice is
								provided for victims;
							</p>
							<p>
								&#183; Initiation of public awareness campaigns to challenge stigma; and
							</p>
							<p>
								Creating pilot projects on supported decision-making for people with disabilities.
