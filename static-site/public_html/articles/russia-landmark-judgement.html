        The European Court of Human Rights has ruled against Russia in an MDAC
        case <em>-</em>
    </strong>
    <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-161760" target="_blank">
        <strong><em>Kocherov and Sergeyeva v. Russia</em></strong>
    </a>
    <strong>
        . It is the first time in European legal history that stripping
        parental rights from a person with an intellectual disability has been
        found to breach international human rights law. The Kocherov family
        gave an interview on Sky News following their legal victory - see the
        story

<p>
    In 2007, Vitaliy Kocherov had a child with his wife who was also a resident
    of the social care institution where he was living in St. Petersburg,
    Russia. The couple were excited when they found out that they would become
    parents, but immediately after the birth of their daughter the authorities
    removed her and placed her in a children's home. They did so only because
    Mr. Kocherov's wife was under guardianship so Mr. Kocherov was not
    considered in law as the parent of his child and had no right to raise his
    daughter, which he wanted to do.
</p>
<p>
    Mother and father did their best to keep in regular contact with their
    daughter visiting her at the children's home, taking her for walks, and
    buying her books, toys and clothes. The children's home was a four-hour
    journey from theirs, and given that the father had a full time job too,
    visiting was often a struggle. The children's home often objected to visits
    on account of the mother's disability. Mr Kocherov then began a legal
    battle to exit the institution and be reunited with his daughter. In
    November 2011, MDAC Lawyer
    <a href="http://www.mdac.info/en/Dmitri-Bartenev" target="_blank">
        Dmitri Bartenev
    </a>
    took legal action to secure housing for the family. Mr Kocherov arranged
    everything for the arrival of his daughter - who was then 4-years-old -
    including toys, books, clothes and furniture.
</p>
<p>
    Everything appeared to be in place until the children's home rejected his
    request for his daughter to live with him, and asked a local court in St.
    Petersburg to intervene. The children's home said because of Mr. Kocherov's
    mental disability and his time previously spent in a social care
    institution, and becuase of the mother was under guardianship, it was
    unsafe for the child to live with them. A court endorsed the position of
    the children's home, prohibiting the father from raising his daughter.
</p>
<p>
    After six years battling the Russian justice system, the family were
    finally reunited with their daughter. With MDAC and lawyer Dmitri
    Bartenev's help, Mr Kocherov sought justice at the European Court of Human
    Rights. Today, the Court unanimously found a violation of Article 8 of the
    European Convention on Human Rights, which sets out the right to respect
    for family life. The Court found that the Government took a "formalistic
    approach, simply endorsing the position of the representative of the
    children's home." The Court criticised the Government for, "silently
    ignoring all evidence and arguments" made by Mr Kocherov resulting in a
    child being unnecessarily and unlawfully separated from her parents.
</p>
<p>
    On hearing the Court's judgment today, Mr Kocherov said:
</p>
<p>
    "Anna is a great kid and we were so happy to be finally able to live as a
    family in our flat. We saw stories of other residents of the social care
    institution who could not save their families. Thanks for supporting us in
    these years!"
</p>
<p>
    Ann Campbell, MDAC Litigation Director, said:
</p>
<p>
    "Russia's draconian laws on legal capacity meant that Mr Kocherov was
    prevented from being a father. MDAC is delighted that the Court has
    recognised this as a violation of the Kocherov family's right to family
    life and ordered redress. The judgment makes clear that a formalistic
    approach to determining parental rights is not sufficient. A full
    determination must be done to ensure the best interests of the child while
    not violating the rights of parents."
</p>
<p>
    MDAC now urges the Russian Government to stop separating parents from their
    children on the basis of stereotypes and prejudice against people with
    mental disabilities. To this end, the Government should amend Article 73(2)
    of the Family Code to remove references to "mental illness" and
    "dangerousness" which perpetuate stereotypes against parents with
    disabilities, in breach of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with
    Disabilities, which Russia ratified in 2012.
