    <strong>
        In a landmark ruling, the European Court of Human Rights has held that
        Russia violated numerous human rights of a young man with mental health
        issues. MDAC, responsible for bringing the case to the Court, welcomes
        the judgment and urges Russia to act promptly to stop similar
        violations.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The applicant in the case, Mr Shtukaturov, is a young man still in his 20s.
    In 2004 he was deprived of legal capacity following a request by his
    mother. He had not been informed about the proceedings and was therefore
    unable to participate in them and the decision was made by the court in ten
    minutes with Mr Shtukaturov remaining unseen and unheard. He was placed
    without his knowledge under the guardianship of his mother and as a result
    was deprived of his capacity to act independently, or at all, in almost all
    areas of life: he was for instance no longer able to sell or buy any
    property on his own, to work, to travel, to choose his place of residence,
    to join associations, to marry, etc. He only became aware of this decision
    by accident one year later in November 2005 and immediately contacted a
    lawyer in Russia whom MDAC works with, who agreed to represent him.
</p>
<p>
    A couple of days later Mr Shtukaturov was detained in a psychiatric
    hospital simply upon the request of his mother. His lawyer tried to visit
    him on several occasions but he was refused access by the hospital
    administration, on the basis that, as Mr Shtukaturov was under
    guardianship, he could not have his own lawyer. Under Russian law, Mr
    Shtukaturov was classed as a "voluntary" patient because his guardian (his
    mother) had consented to his admission to hospital. Mr Shtukaturov on
    several occasions asked to leave the hospital. His requests were refused
    and his detention continued.
</p>
<p>
    Mr Shtukaturov attempted to appeal his guardianship status and the lack of
    access to his attorney through the Russian courts. He failed in both
    attempts on the grounds that as he was under guardianship he had no legal
    standing to make such appeals. He therefore filed a case with the European
    Court of Human Rights which in March 2006 ordered the Russian Government to
    allow the lawyer access to him. The Russian authorities simply ignored the
    order with the result that Mr Shtukaturov remained under detention in the
    institution for seven months and was strictly prohibited in communicating
    with the outside world. Only upon his release was he able to pursue further
    the claim before the European Court.
</p>
<p>
    In its judgment today the European Court of Human Rights found several
    violations of the European Convention on Human Rights. These include the
    following.
</p>
<p>
    &#183; deprivation of legal capacity constitutes a "very serious"
    interference of a person's private life, it is applied indefinitely, and
    cannot be challenged by the person under guardianship (Article 8 of the
    ECHR)
</p>
<p>
    &#183; a mental illness cannot be the sole reason to justify stripping
    someone of legal capacity and Russian law is disproportionate in allowing
    this to happen without making provision for a tailor-made response (Article
    8 of the ECHR)
</p>
<p>
    &#183; the guardianship proceedings were unfair because they wholly
    excluded Mr Shtukaturov (Article 6 of the ECHR)
</p>
<p>
    &#183; deprivation of legal capacity is not a ground to deprive a person of
    their liberty (Article 5(1) of the ECHR)
</p>
<p>
    &#183; every person who is detained - including those who have been
    deprived of their legal capacity - should have the right to pursue
    independently a legal review to challenge their detention (Article 5(4) of
    the ECHR)
</p>
<p>
    &#183; the Russian Government failed to comply with an "interim measure" of
    the European Court ordering it to allow Mr Shtukaturov's lawyer to have
    access to him (Article 34 of the ECHR)
</p>
<p>
    Welcoming the judgment, MDAC's Executive Director, Oliver Lewis, said:
</p>
<p>
    "The judgment, which documents how Mr Shtukaturov was arbitrarily stripped
    of his legal capacity without his knowledge, consequently detained simply
    on the request of his mother, and then denied any contact with his own
    lawyer or the judicial system, makes chilling reading. This system of
    absolute exclusion and discrimination of Mr Shtukaturov which is typical
    for many people with disabilities in Russia is contrary to international
    human rights law. We therefore call on the Russian Government to respond to
    this judgement by undertaking a comprehensive review of all relevant laws,
    services and their implementation."
