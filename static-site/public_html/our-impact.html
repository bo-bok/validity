							<h1 class="page-heading">Our Impact</h1>
							<p>When society decides that you have a learning disability or a mental health issue, the odds are stacked against you.</p>
							<p>We fearlessly represent people through the courts. We give them a voice to demand that their governments change unjust laws. We won’t stop until those voices are heard. Equality and inclusion are not abstract concepts. They are tangible realities. They are rights that can be achieved...but they have to be fought for.</p>

								<h1>All Schools</h1>
								<p>Making sure no child is denied inclusive education. Only 10% of children with disabilites are in school. Often there is no way for their paretns to challenge exclusion Courts do not order local governments to provide inclusive education. Many governments are unaware of their obligation to roll out a sytem toofight inclusion for all.</p>
								<p>Thats why we are striving for courts to recognise the righ of children to be educated in inclusive schools.</p>

Segregation has left people isolated, exploited and abused. In Europe alone, we estimate two million people are segregated just because they have a disability.</p>

								<h1>I'm a person</h1>
								<p>Calling for an end to brutal systems of guardianship. People with mental disabilites are often labelled  by the law as incompetant, and put under house. Courts strip their right to marry, have sex, vote, own a house, decide their own medical treatment. People in institutions even have their assets seized and have no means of accessing justice.</p>
								<p>That is why we are sellecting test cases to lift guardianship and put in place support for people to author their own lives.  By campaign grassroots NGO’s we will challenge governemtns to think in a different way.</p>
