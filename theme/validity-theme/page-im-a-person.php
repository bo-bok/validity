          <h1>I'm a person</h1>
          <p>Calling for an end to brutal systems of guardianship. People with mental health issues or intellectual disabilities are often labelled by the law as incompetent, and put under guardianship. Courts strip their rights to marry, have a family, vote, own a house, sign an employment contract or even decide their own medical treatment. People in in this Kafkaesque situation have no means of accessing justice.</p>
          <p>That is why we select test cases to challenge guardianship and urge state structures to put in place support for people to author their own lives. By campaigning with grassroots NGOs we enable governments to think in a different way.</p>
